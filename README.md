## Task 1 : Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
## Task 2 : Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
## Task 3 : Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
## Task 4 : Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
